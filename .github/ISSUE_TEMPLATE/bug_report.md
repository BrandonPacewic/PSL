**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior vs Actual behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen against what actually happened in practice

**Please read the documentation**
I ask that you read the documentation to ensure that this is really a bug and not a feature. If it is a feature and you think that it should work differently this might be a feature request
